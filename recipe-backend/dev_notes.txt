        - use this endpoint s reference for idMeal and recipe_title

                - json data ref
                    "meals": [
                                {

            - added validators.py and updated model to use it
            - udpated field idMeal to be a charField

        - After building saved_recipes model and asking charGpt to make injection script,
            the current unique assignments for idMeal and recipe_title are global and should
            be for the user only.
            - Discussed with team.. yes it should be for user, alllowing other to save same recipe if needed
        - Discussed with chatGpt and reviewing DRF link, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/models/options/#unique-together
