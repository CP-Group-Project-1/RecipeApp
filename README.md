## üß© Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

### **Prerequisites**
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- (Optional for deployment) An AWS EC2 instance configured with Docker



### **Local Setup Using Docker**

1. **Clone the repository**

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-app.git
   cd recipe-app

2.	Run the production build locally

        ./run_build_prod.sh


3.	Access the app

	‚Ä¢ Full-Stack Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:80

    (Serves the Vite/React frontend via NGINX and routes API calls to the Django backend)



## üöÄ Production Deployment (EC2)

To deploy the application to a live environment on AWS EC2, follow the steps below:

1. Build and Push Docker Images (Local)

    ./build-and-push-images.sh

Builds both frontend and backend images and pushes them to DockerHub.

2. Create the AWS EC2 Instance
```bash
	‚Ä¢	Launch a new EC2 instance (Ubuntu recommended)
	‚Ä¢	Ensure port 80 is open in the security group
	‚Ä¢	Save your SSH PEM key locally
```

3. Verify SSH Access (Important ‚úÖ)

Before transferring files, test SSH access to your instance:

    ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<your-ec2-ip>

	If this works, you‚Äôre ready to proceed. If not, check your PEM file, IP address, and EC2 security group settings.

4. Transfer Files to EC2

    ./xnfr_to_ec2.sh

    Transfers:
    ```bash
        ‚Ä¢	docker-compose.prod.yml
        ‚Ä¢	pull_images.sh
        ‚Ä¢	run_ec2.sh
        ‚Ä¢	setup-ec2.sh
        ‚Ä¢	Any additional config or environment files
    ```

5. SSH into the EC2 Instance
    ```bash
    ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<your-ec2-ip>
    ```

6. Set Up the Environment

    ./setup-ec2.sh

Installs Docker, Docker Compose, and system dependencies.

7. Pull Docker Images

    ./pull_images.sh

8. Run the Application

    ./run_ec2.sh

Starts the frontend (NGINX), backend (Gunicorn), and database services using Docker Compose.

## üßë‚Äçüç≥ Usage

Once the application is running, users can:
```bash
	1.	Sign Up / Log In
            - Create an account or log into an existing one to access personalized features.

	2.	Browse Recipes
            - Explore meals by category, cuisine, or ingredients using data from TheMealDB.

	3.	Save Recipes
            - Select favorite meals and save them to your personal recipe list.

	4.	Generate a Shopping List
            - Choose a saved recipe and add its ingredients to your shopping list.

	5.	Email the Shopping List
        - Click to receive your shopping list by email. The ingredients will be:
	        ‚Ä¢	Organized into categories (e.g., Produce, Spices, Dairy)
	        ‚Ä¢	Styled and branded with the RecipeApp logo
        Important Note:
            - Due to Webmail spam identifiers, user may need to send the email twice initially so the 
             email receiver knows that its not spam. Else it may take sometime for the email to be received
```


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes About Deployment Scripts

Before running the deployment scripts, please review their contents and ensure the following requirements are met:
## üîê Required Environment Variables
```bash
    
    The following environment variables must be set before running the application:

    | Variable Name         | Description                                                 |
    |-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------| 
    | `SECRET_KEY`          | Django secret key used for cryptographic signing            |
    | `DEBUG`               | Set to `True` for local development, `False` for production |
    | `DB_NAME`             | Name of the PostgreSQL database                             |
    | `DB_USER`             | Username for the PostgreSQL database                        |

    | `GEMINI_API_KEY`      | API key for Google Gemini AI, used to categorize ingredients|

    > These can be stored in a `.env` file for local development or managed securely via AWS Secrets Manager in production.


	‚Ä¢	build-and-push-images.sh
	    - Requires DockerHub authentication
	    - Uses Git tags or commit hashes for versioning
	    - Pushes images to a DockerHub repo (update this if needed)

	‚Ä¢	run_build_prod.sh
	    - Runs the app locally in production mode
	    - Expects proper environment configuration or access to AWS Secrets Manager
        
	‚Ä¢	xnfr_to_ec2.sh

	‚Ä¢	setup-ec2.sh
	    - Installs Docker and Docker Compose
	    - Requires sudo privileges on the EC2 instance

	‚Ä¢	pull_images.sh
